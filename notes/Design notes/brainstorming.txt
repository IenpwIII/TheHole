    On character creation, give option of creating backstory, etc.

    Players encouraged to die lots
    

Rooms randomly generated on first entry
    Multi-level dungeon
    Rooms can contain:
        items
            Players can create items subject to moderator review
        monsters
        stairs
        escape
            Very low chance of room containing escape (majority of characters will die without escaping)
        easter eggs, information, mods to environment, random flavor (statues, blood stains, scratches in walls, etc.)
        non-monster encounters (traps, obstacles, etc., puzzles)
Logs
    Player enters room and logs what happens - player determines what goes on log
    If player enters room generated for other player, receives log of room history
    Computer can randomly add events to room history
    Room histories are persistent

    Sign ups and other incentives to encourage good, realistic RP
    Game will sometimes predetermine outcome of events, and ask players to supply details
Players given persistent inventories
    All items assigned by game, not players
Game lore
    (semi)randomly (?) generated bits of game lore in dungeon rooms
    Grand overarching lore, game backstory, etc.
